# Radlibs Command Line Interface

This version of radlibs is available for use at command line whenever you're in the mood!

## Usage

After installing, just write your chosen phrase/s at command line, such as:

```
> radlibsme "I {verb} that {noun} so {adjective}ly!"
I ink that trifle so blankly!
```

## Installation

This is just available on github right now, but I'll get it up on pypi as soon as I can. Clone this repo, then make your way to the radlibs-cli folder.

```
pip install .
```

For deeper details on the package functionality, check out [the python version](https://github.com/skirmer/radlibs). This is a wrapper of the python version, so their functionalities will match.
